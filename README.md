I could have done more for the movable object assignment, like adding collision detection, random objects the player can't move through, chasing enemies, or maybe even gone the route of Snake or Brick Breaker.<br>
But I wanted to move onto the extra modules we were given access to - Node, SQL and Express.<br><br>
As it stands, the player can click to move the ball, or move it with arrows/WASD. If moved through clicks, the player is locked out from moving again by click or arrows/WASD until the ball has moved to the intended target.
